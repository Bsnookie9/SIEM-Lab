# SIEM-Lab
This is a SIEM Lab using Azure Sentinel, Log Analytics Workspace, and a Virtual Machine  

This lab was designed by [Josh Madakor](https://www.youtube.com/@JoshMadakor) and is a great way to gain experience with an SIEM without having an SIEM career.  

Here is the [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoZeVbbZ0o0) that walks you through the entire lab, from start to finish.
